# Script 4: Log File Analyzer
# Author: Trisha Giri | Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Reads a log file line by line, counts occurrences
#          of a keyword, and prints matching lines

# --- Accept command line arguments ---
LOGFILE=$1              # First argument: path to the log file
KEYWORD=${2:-"error"}   # Second argument: keyword to search for
                        # If no keyword given, defaults to "error"

# --- Counter variable to track matches ---
COUNT=0

# --- Check if the log file was provided and exists ---
if [ -z "$LOGFILE" ]; then
    # -z checks if the variable is empty
    echo "Usage: bash script4.sh <logfile> [keyword]"
    echo "Example: bash script4.sh testlog.txt error"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$LOGFILE" ]; then
    # ! -f checks if the file does NOT exist
    echo "Error: File '$LOGFILE' not found."
    exit 1
fi

# --- Check if the file is empty ---
if [ ! -s "$LOGFILE" ]; then
    # ! -s checks if the file has zero size
    echo "Warning: File '$LOGFILE' is empty. Nothing to analyze."
    exit 1
fi
