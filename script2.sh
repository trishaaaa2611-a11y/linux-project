# Script 2: FOSS Package Inspector
# Author: Trisha Giri | Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Checks if Python is installed, shows its details,
#          and prints a philosophy note using a case statement

# --- Define the package to inspect ---
PACKAGE="python3-minimal"   # The package we are auditing

# --- Check if the package is installed ---
if dpkg -s $PACKAGE &>/dev/null; then
    # If installed, print confirmation and fetch details
    echo "============================================"
    echo "  Package '$PACKAGE' is INSTALLED"
    echo "============================================"
    echo ""

    # Show version, maintainer, and description from package manager
    echo "--- Package Details ---"
    dpkg -s $PACKAGE | grep -E 'Version|Maintainer|Description'
    echo ""

    # Show the actual python3 version directly
    echo "--- Python Version ---"
    python3 --version
    echo ""

else
    # If not installed, inform the user
    echo "Package '$PACKAGE' is NOT installed on this system."
    echo "To install it, run: sudo apt install python3"
    exit 1   # Exit the script with an error code
fi

# --- Case statement: print philosophy note based on package name ---
echo "--- Open Source Philosophy Note ---"
