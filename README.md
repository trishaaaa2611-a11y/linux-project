## 📖 About This Project

> *"Every line of code you write in your career will sit on top of open-source foundations. Understanding the philosophy behind that is not optional — it is part of being a professional."*
> — OSS Course, VIT Bhopal

This repository is a structured audit of **Python** — one of the world's most widely used open-source programming languages. The audit covers Python's origin story, its license and freedoms, its Linux footprint, its ecosystem, and a critical comparison against proprietary alternatives.

Alongside the written report, this repository contains **5 shell scripts** that demonstrate practical Linux and Bash scripting skills — from system inspection to log analysis to interactive manifesto generation.

## 🐍 Why Python?

```
1989  →  Guido van Rossum starts Python over Christmas holidays
1991  →  Python 0.9.0 released openly on Usenet
2001  →  Python Software Foundation (PSF) established
2008  →  Python 3 released
2024  →  #1 most popular language on TIOBE Index
```

Python was born out of frustration with closed, inaccessible tools. Guido chose to share it freely — and that single decision changed the entire landscape of programming.

## 🖥️ Scripts Overview

### Script 1 — System Identity Report
![Concepts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-Variables%20|%20Echo%20|%20Command%20Substitution-blue?style=flat-square)

Displays a formatted welcome screen showing the Linux distribution, kernel version, logged-in user, system uptime, current date and time, and the open-source license covering the OS.

```bash
bash script1.sh
```

---

### Script 2 — FOSS Package Inspector
![Concepts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-if--else%20|%20case%20statement%20|%20dpkg%20|%20grep-blue?style=flat-square)

Checks whether Python is installed on the system using `dpkg`, fetches its version, maintainer, and description, then uses a `case` statement to print a philosophy note about the package.

```bash
bash script2.sh
```

---

### Script 3 — Disk and Permission Auditor
![Concepts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-for%20loop%20|%20ls%20|%20du%20|%20awk-blue?style=flat-square)

Loops through a list of critical system directories (`/etc`, `/var/log`, `/home`, `/usr/bin`, `/tmp`) using a `for` loop and reports each directory's size, permissions, owner, and group. Also performs a dedicated check on Python's library directory.

```bash
bash script3.sh
```

---

### Script 4 — Log File Analyzer
![Concepts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-while%20loop%20|%20counter%20|%20arguments%20|%20grep%20|%20tail-blue?style=flat-square)

Accepts a log file and keyword as command-line arguments. Reads the file line by line using a `while` loop, counts how many lines contain the keyword, and displays the last 5 matching lines. Defaults to searching for `error` if no keyword is provided.

```bash
# Basic usage
bash script4.sh testlog.txt error

# Try different keywords
bash script4.sh testlog.txt warning
bash script4.sh testlog.txt info
```

---

### Script 5 — Open Source Manifesto Generator
![Concepts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Concepts-read%20|%20string%20concat%20|%20file%20write%20|%20aliases-blue?style=flat-square)

An interactive script that asks the user 3 questions, then composes a personalised open source philosophy statement using their answers. The manifesto is saved to a `.txt` file named after the current user and displayed on screen.

```bash
bash script5.sh
```

> 💡 This script is **interactive** — it will prompt you with 3 questions. Type your answers and press `Enter` after each one.
