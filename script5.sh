# Script 5: Open Source Manifesto Generator
# Author: Trisha Giri | Course: Open Source Software
# Purpose: Asks the user 3 questions interactively and generates
#          a personalised open source philosophy statement,
#          then saves it to a .txt file

# --- Alias concept demonstrated ---
# In a real shell session you could define:
# alias manifest='bash script5.sh'
# This would let you type 'manifest' instead of 'bash script5.sh'
# Aliases make long commands shorter and more memorable

echo "personal open source manifesto."

# --- Read user input interactively ---
# 'read -p' displays a prompt and waits for the user to type

read -p "1. Name one open-source tool you use every day: " TOOL
echo ""

read -p "2. In one word, what does 'freedom' mean to you? " FREEDOM
echo ""

read -p "3. Name one thing you would build and share freely: " BUILD

DATE=$(date '+%d %B %Y')         # Formats date as: 29 March 2026
USERNAME=$(whoami)               # Gets the current Linux username

# --- Define the output filename ---
# String concatenation: combining "manifesto_" + username + ".txt"
OUTPUT="manifesto_${USERNAME}.txt"

# --- Compose the manifesto paragraph and write to file ---
# '>' creates the file (overwrites if exists)
# '>>' appends to the file (adds without overwriting)
